# Piscine 42

This repository contains the projects I completed during the 42 Piscine, an intense 4-week programming bootcamp created by 42 programming school, where students are challenged to solve problems through peer-to-peer learning and self-driven development.

### What you'll find:
- **C Programming**: Core exercises and projects focused on algorithms, memory management, and system-level programming.
- **Problem-Solving**: Projects designed to develop problem-solving skills and adapt to new challenges quickly.

Feel free to explore the code! Keep swimming :)
